# Benchmarkdotnet

BenchmarkDotNet is an open-source library in .NET code, that gives accurate measure of execution time of your code. A useful tool for testing any methods or logical code written in your applications, making informed decisions on improving your code for optimimal results.

## Usage
I have written an example code, followed using online tutorials as the structure can be copied and tailored to your requirements. 

From my learnings, I attempted to apply benchmark tool on a practical project and found that it results in errors. This tool can only be used as a separate project and you will have to use console application project when creating one. You will need to test your code in isolation from the application you are implementing the code to.
